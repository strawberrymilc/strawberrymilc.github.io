                        <p>In the era of LGBT assimilationism, the justification for queer existence has become an issue of science rather than an issue of humanity. In the past, queer activists believed in their right to exist simply by merit of being alive. Now, many of us justify our existence using medical studies instead. Scientific studies supporting queer identities is something to celebrate, but resting queer validity on the neatly-defined edges of scienitific research creates great dangers for people whose identities exist outside of more well-researched groups. In the face of such exclusivity, giving an inclusive definition of queer is more important than ever. However, not all identities of a sexual or gender minority are considered to be ‘queer’ by the broader group. People who use neopronouns (not he, she, or they), asexual spectrum identifying people, trans people who do not pursue medical intervention, and many others are frequently excluded from queer labels under the pretense of a lack of scientific or societal support. People such as these are emblematic of the queer movement as a whole, moreso than those whose identities have come into prescriptive acceptance. Supporting groups not supported by hegemonic systems of control, simply by the merit of their right to exist is the spirit of queer activism. ‘Queer’ can not and should not be defined by participation in well-defined, scientifically supported subgroups of the LGBT+ movement. Instead, it should be rather less neatly defined as a collective identity of peoples who live in contrast to heterogendered norms.  </p>
                        <p>Now that the scientific community is becoming more accepting of queer identities, it may not be obvious why we should still avoid defining ourselves through a scientific lens. Would it not be better to validate ourselves in the eyes of the broader public through the reliable findings of science? One problem with this approach is the implied acceptance of the idea that some queer identities might not be valid or acceptable. If we use science as evidence for the existence of some of our identities, it implies that that is a requirement for any queer identity to be ‘real’. This narrative is in direct contrast to the original definition of queer, being that of people whose identities are in some form a rebellion to heteronormative culture. Instead of focusing on non-normativity as a defining characteristic of ‘queerness’, a scientific, categorical basis for queerness propels the majority among us into normative culture whilst demonizing the most underrepresented queer people as illegitamate and delusional. As eloquently stated in “Building an Abolitionist Trans and Queer Movement with Everything We’ve Got”, “The true potential of queer and trans politics cannot be found in attempting to reinforce our tenuous right to exist by undermining someone else’s. If it is not clear already, we are all in this together.” (p. 32). The right for people within sexual and gender minorities to exist is won by right of our humanity alone.</p>
