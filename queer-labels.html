                        <p>In the era of LGBT assimilationism, the justification for queer existence has become an issue of science rather than an issue of humanity. In the past, queer activists believed in their right to exist simply by merit of being alive. Now, many justify their existence using medical studies instead. Scientific studies supporting queer identities is something to celebrate, but resting queer validity on the neatly-defined edges of scienitific research creates great dangers for people whose identities exist outside of more well-researched groups. In the face of such exclusivity, giving an inclusive definition of queer is more important than ever. However, not all identities of a sexual or gender minority are considered to be ‘queer’ by the broader group. People who use neopronouns (not he, she, or they), asexual spectrum identifying people, trans people who do not pursue medical intervention, and many others are frequently excluded from queer labels under the pretense of a lack of scientific or societal support. People such as these are emblematic of the queer movement as a whole, moreso than those whose identities have come into prescriptive acceptance. Supporting groups not supported by hegemonic systems of control, simply by the merit of their right to exist is the spirit of queer activism. ‘Queer’ can not and should not be defined by participation in well-defined, scientifically supported subgroups of the LGBT+ movement. Instead, it should be rather less neatly defined as a collective identity of peoples who live in contrast to heterogendered norms.  </p>
                        <p>Now that the scientific community is becoming more accepting of queer identities, it may not be obvious why queer people should still avoid defining themselves through a scientific lens. Would it not be better to be validated in the eyes of the broader public through the reliable findings of science? One problem with this approach is the implied acceptance of the idea that some queer identities might not be valid or acceptable. If we use science as evidence for the existence of some queer identities, it implies that that is a requirement for any queer identity to be ‘real’. This narrative is in direct contrast to the original definition of queer, being that of people whose identities are in some form a rebellion to heteronormative culture. Instead of focusing on non-normativity as a defining characteristic of ‘queerness’, a scientific, categorical basis for queerness propels the majority of queer people into normative culture whilst demonizing the most underrepresented queer people as illegitamate and delusional. As eloquently stated in “Building an Abolitionist Trans and Queer Movement with Everything We’ve Got”, “The true potential of queer and trans politics cannot be found in attempting to reinforce our tenuous right to exist by undermining someone else’s. If it is not clear already, we are all in this together.” (p. 32). The right for people within sexual and gender minorities to exist is won by right of their humanity alone.</p>
                        <p>Although it has been known that the struggles of people within sexual and gender minorities are related for a long time, it is only recently that a term including all of these people came to be widely used. This term, ‘queer’, was created to combat attempts to create strict categorizations of people within sexual and gender minority communities, and to promote unity amongst them. According to Cathy J. Cohen’s “Punks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics”, scholars and participants of queer movements agree that the term “queer” rose to popularity in the early 1990’s. Theorists who used the term at the time focused on rejecting cultural norms that promoted “heterogendered” worldviews and behaviors as the norm. Crucially, these experts “sought to replace socially named and presumably stable categories of sexual expression with a new fluid movement” (p. 438). This definition of queer is directly in conflict with a definition that requires membership in a well known and scientifically-affirmed subgroup of sexual and gender minorities. This may be in part due to the timing in which ‘queer’ started to be widely used. The early 1990’s also marked the end of the main outbreak of the AIDs epidemic in western nations. There was little mutual understanding between scientific bodies and queer people, making it clear why queer theorists at the time were directly opposed to using “socially named” categories in the definition of queer. Queer people back then did not ask for permission to exist because they knew that if they didn’t allow themselves to take up space, no one would. Their specific preferences and identities did not matter so much so as to their right to exist as someone who contradicted societal norms. Putting queers into labeled boxes is antithetical to the very point of queerness - being that it the opposite of what can be well defined within heteronormative culture. </p>
                        <p>When discussing the rights of gay, lesbian, trans, and other large groups within the queer community, many default to the justification that [that identity] is had from birth, appears in nature, is corroborated by science, existed in historical human populations, etc. Defending queer existence using irrefutable facts such as these is tempting, but ultimately implies the assimilationist belief that queer people are only valid if they are supported by hegemonic institutions. Queer people are spared many of the violences of the past because of the work of their anti-assimilationist predecessors. If they were to embrace assimilationism in deciding which queer people we create space for, they are not only going against their history of rebellion, but also playing into a deep irony by using the fruits of the efforts of queer elders to tear down other queer people. Science is a wonderful tool for better understanding queer people and their bodies, but it is not a good justification for their existence. Queer people hold the right to exist with or without the permission of the normative culture, simply because they are human. </p>
